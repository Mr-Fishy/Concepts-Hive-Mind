## Reasons for Studying Concepts of Programming Languages

The following is considered a compelling list of potential benefits of studying concepts of programming languages:
### Increased capacity to express ideas.

It is widely believed that it is difficult for people to conceptualize structures they cannot describe, verbally or in writing of natural language.

Programmers, can be considered to have a similar constraint. Thus programmers can increase their range of software development, and conceptualization through learning new language constructs.

Some may argue that learning the capabilities of other languages do not help a programmer who is forced to use a language that lacks such capabilities. However that argument is not well supported, because language constructs can often be simulated in other languages that do not support those constructs directly. **For example, a C programmer who had learned the structure and uses of associative arrays in Perl might design structures that simulate associative arrays in that language.** To summarize, the study of programming languages builds an appreciation for valuable language features and constructs, and encourages programmers to use them even when a language does not directly support such constructs.
### Improved Background for Choosing Appropriate Languages


### Increased Ability to Learn New Languages


### Better Understanding of the Significance of Implementation


### Better Use of Languages that are Already Known


### Overall Advancement of Computing
