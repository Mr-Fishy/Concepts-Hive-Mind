Computers have been applied to a wide range of different areas. From controlling nuclear power plants to providing video games in mobile phones. Because of the great diversity in computer use, programming languages with very different goals have been developed. 
## Scientific Applications

The first digital computers, which appeared in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were invented and used for [[scientific applications]].

- **Core Requirements**: These applications typically used relatively simple [[data structures]] but required large numbers of [[floating-point arithmetic]] computations.
- **Common Constructs**:
	- **Data Structures**: [[arrays]] and [[matrices]]
	- **Control Structures**: [[loops]] and [[selection structures]] (conditionals)

The early [[high-level languages]] invented for scientific applications were designed to provide for those needs.

- **Primary Competition**: [[assembly language]]
- **Primary Concern**: [[computational efficiency]]

The first language for scientific applications was [[Fortran]]. [[ALGOL 60]] and most of its descendants were also intended to be used in this area, although they were designed to be used in related areas as well.

For some scientific applications where efficiency is the primary concern such as in [[high-performance computing]], no subsequent language is significantly better than [[Fortran]], which explains why it is still used today.
## Business Applications

The use of computers for [[Business Applications]] began in the 1950s. Special computers were developed for this purpose, along with special languages.

The first successful [[High-Level Language]] for business was [[COBOL]], with its initial version appearing in 1960. It probably still is the most commonly used language for these applications, particularly in [[Mainframe Computing]] and finance.

[[Business-oriented languages]] are characterized by:

- Facilities for producing elaborate reports ([[Report Generation]]).
    
- Precise ways of describing and storing [[Decimal Data Types]] and [[Character Data]].
    
- The ability to specify [[Decimal Arithmetic]] operations (which avoids the rounding errors of [[Floating-Point Arithmetic]]).
    

There have been few developments in business application languages outside the development and evolution of [[COBOL]]. Therefore, this book includes only limited discussions of the structures in [[COBOL]].
