This section outlines a set of criteria for evaluating programming languages, focusing on their impact on the software development process.

> [!note] The four most important criteria are:
> 
> 1. [[Readability]]
>     
> 2. [[Writability]]
>     
> 3. [[Reliability]]
>     
> 4. [[Cost]] (Cost is related to the other three but discussed separately).

**Language Evaluation Criteria**
