## Providing descriptions of languages

In the past providing descriptions of programming languages were not  easily understandable, because of the *nonstandard* way of #notation, since there was no standard, or at least no universal standard.

The main problem posed by creating a description of a programming language is the diversity of people who must understand it, from designers, implement, and users .

Programming languages can be divided into #syntax and #semantics.
The #syntax forms the expressions, program units and statements
The #semantics gives meaning to those expressions statements and program units.

Despite the separation for learning, syntax and semantics are related, the #semantics  should follow from the #syntax , as the appearance of a *statement* should suggest what it is meant to do.

#syntax is easier to describe because there is now an accepted standard notation for syntax description, yet none exist yet for #semantics
