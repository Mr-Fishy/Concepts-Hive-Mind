# Backus Naur Form and Context-Free Grammars

## Context-Free Grammars

There are two of four generative devices or #grammars that define four classes of language.

Two of them, named #context-free and #regular. Are useful for describing the syntax of programming languages.

#tokens of programming languages can can be described by regular grammars. 
The #syntax can be described mostly, by context-free grammars.


## Origins of Backus-Naur Form

A new paper describing the language of ALGOL 58, was presented by John Backus, which was a new formal notation for specifying language syntax.

The notation would be modified later for ALGOL 60 by Peter Naur. And shortly after it would be called Backus-Naur Form  or #BNF for short.


BNF is considerably close to Chomsky's generative devices for #context-free languages, called context-free #grammars.

BNF and grammar are used interchangably.


## Fundamentals

A #metalanguage is a languages that is use to describe another language. BNF is a metalanguage for programming languages.

BNF uses
