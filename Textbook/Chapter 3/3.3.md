# Backus Naur Form and Context-Free Grammars

## Context-Free Grammars

There are two of four generative devices or #grammars that define four classes of language.

Two of them, named #context-free and #regular. Are useful for describing the syntax of programming languages.

#tokens of programming languages can can be described by regular grammars. 
The #syntax can be described mostly, by context-free grammars.


## Origins of Backus-Naur Form

A new paper describing the language of ALGOL 58, was presented by John Backus, which was a new formal notation for specifying language syntax.

The notation would be modified later for ALGOL 60 by Peter Naur. And shortly after it would be called Backus-Naur Form  or #BNF for short.


BNF is considerably close to Chomsky's generative devices for #context-free languages, called context-free #grammars.

BNF and grammar are used interchangably.


## Fundamentals

A #metalanguage is a languages that is use to describe another language. BNF is a metalanguage for programming languages.

BNF uses abstractions for syntactic structures.

In a context free grammar there are two "sides" of a definition. known as #LHS(Left hand side) and #RHS(Right hand side).

The RHS and LHS of a definition consists of tokens, lexemes and maybe other definitions.

Together, these concepts make a #rule or #production. 

Taking Java for instance, a definition may take the appearance of:
```
<assign>-> <var> = <expression>
```

and it becomes obvious that the sentence above must be actually defined for this to be useful, here is an example:
```
<Assign>
|
<var>=<expression>
|
myvar = <expression>
|
myvar = 1
```

The abstractions in a grammar are called #non-terminals and the #lexemes  and #tokens are of rules are called #terminals. 

In short, a BNF description/grammar is a collection of rules.


Non-terminals can have distinct definitions, representing different accepted syntactic forms in the language.

Separate definitions can be separated by the | symbol.

Due to the nature of BNF, proper application can result in order of constructs, nested structures, operator precedence and associativity.

## Describing Lists

To describe a list in math, it is written with an ellipsis (...). BNF does not have this ellipsis, so recursion is used as an alternative.

A rule is considered #recursive if its LHS appears in its RHS. As so:
```
<list>->ident
|ident,<ident_list>
```
