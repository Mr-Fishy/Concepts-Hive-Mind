Parsers for programming languages construct parse trees for given programs. In some cases, the parse tree is only implicitly constructed, meaning that perhaps only a traversal of the tree is generated. But in all cases, the information required to build the parse tree is created during the parse. Both parse trees and derivations include all of the syntactic information needed by a language processor.

Parsers are categorized according to the direction in which they build parse trees. The two broad classes of parsers are top-down, in which the tree is built from the root downward to the leaves, and bottom-up, in which the parse tree is built from the leaves upward to the root.

For programming languages, terminal symbols are the small-scale syntactic constructs of the language, what we have referred to as lexemes. The nonterminal symbols of programming languages are usually connotative names or abbreviations, surrounded by angle brackets—for example, <while_­statement>, <expr>, and <function_def>. The sentences of a language (­programs, in the case of a programming language) are strings of terminals. Mixed strings describe right-hand sides (RHSs) of grammar rules and are used in parsing algorithms.
