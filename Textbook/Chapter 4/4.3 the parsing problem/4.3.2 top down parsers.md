A top-down parser traces or builds a parse tree in preorder. A preorder traversal of a parse tree begins with the root. Each node is visited before its branches are followed. Branches from a particular node are followed in left-to-right order. This corresponds to a leftmost derivation.

The most common top-down parsing algorithms are closely related. A recursive-descent parser is a coded version of a syntax analyzer based directly on the BNF description of the syntax of language. The most common alternative to recursive descent is to use a parsing table, rather than code, to implement the BNF rules. Both of these, which are called LL ­algorithms, are equally powerful, meaning they work on the same subset of all context-free grammars. The first L in LL specifies a left-to-right scan of the input; the second L specifies that a leftmost derivation is generated. Section 4.4 introduces the recursive-descent approach to implementing an LL parser.
