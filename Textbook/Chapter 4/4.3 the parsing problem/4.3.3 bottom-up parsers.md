A bottom-up parser constructs a parse tree by beginning at the leaves and progressing toward the root. This parse order corresponds to the reverse of a rightmost derivation. That is, the sentential forms of the derivation are produced in order of last to first.

A bottom-up parser constructs a parse tree by beginning at the leaves and progressing toward the root. This parse order corresponds to the reverse of a rightmost derivation. That is, the sentential forms of the derivation are produced in order of last to first.

The most common bottom-up parsing algorithms are in the LR family, where the L specifies a left-to-right scan of the input and the R specifies that a rightmost derivation is generated.
