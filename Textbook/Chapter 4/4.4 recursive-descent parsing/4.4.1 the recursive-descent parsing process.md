A recursive-descent parser is so named because it consists of a collection of subprograms, many of which are recursive, and it produces a parse tree in top-down order. This recursion is a reflection of the nature of programming languages, which include several different kinds of nested structures. For example, statements are often nested in other statements. Also, parentheses in expressions must be properly nested. The syntax of these structures is naturally described with recursive grammar rules.

EBNF is ideally suited for recursive-descent parsers. Recall from ­Chapter 3 that the primary EBNF extensions are braces, which specify that what they enclose can appear zero or more times, and brackets, which specify that what they enclose can appear once or not at all.

A recursive-descent parser has a subprogram for each nonterminal in its associated grammar. The responsibility of the subprogram associated with a particular nonterminal is as follows: When given an input string, it traces out the parse tree that can be rooted at that nonterminal and whose leaves match the input string. In effect, a recursive-descent parsing subprogram is a parser for the language (set of strings) that is generated by its associated nonterminal.
